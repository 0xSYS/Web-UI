# Web-UI
A collection of custom html elements I found on the internet to use them in my web/tauri application projects

# Supported UI elements
- Button
- Checkbox
- Radio buttons
- List selector
- Tabs
- Textarea
- User text input
- Range slider
- Dialog window
- Color picker
- Progress bar
- Spiner loaders



#### <u>This project is still in development and it was never tested!</u>



# Todo
- Implement theme manager
- Changing class names for some elements
- Making easier to use some of the ui elements
- ✅ Publishing the html page [Link Here]("https://pianoarts2007.github.io/Web-UI/")
- Adding the merged css components and js utils too
- Minimizing css code and js code (only for the full component merge)
- Adding Video/Audio Elements
- ✅ Hostig the scripts with CDN
- ✅ Adding all the cdn links to the web page



## Usage
- Download or copy the links of the required components
- Open `index.html` with any browser to preview and choose the ui elements
